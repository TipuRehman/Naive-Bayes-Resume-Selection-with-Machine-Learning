# Resume Selector with Naive Bayes

This is a mini-project from the Coursera guided project **“Naive Bayes 101: Resume Selection with Machine Learning”**, where I built a simple machine learning model that classifies resumes into two categories **'Data Science'** and **'Not Data Science'**.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In today's competitive job market, HR teams receive thousands of resumes for open roles. Manually filtering relevant resumes is time-consuming. This project explores how machine learning, specifically the **Naive Bayes algorithm**, can be used to automate the initial resume screening process.

## 💡 What I Did

- Used **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to process and clean resume text data.
- Applied **CountVectorizer** to transform the text into numerical features.
- Trained a **Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier** on the labeled resume data.
- Evaluated model accuracy and made predictions to identify Data Science-related resumes.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Resume Selector with Naive Bayes.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing code and explanations.
- `resumes.csv`: Sample dataset of resumes with labels (Data Science / Not Data Science).
- `README.md`: Project summary and setup instructions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn (Naive Bayes, CountVectorizer, train_test_split)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

## 📊 Key Concepts Applied

- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Tokenization and vectorization
- Supervised machine learning (Naive Bayes)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
